                <p class="text-muted">After 2 months I've decided to do something useful during my python course. So I built a simple program with CLI that does som math and technical stuff, it was relatively simple calculator, no data structures, no OOP, just calculator.
                    It was called SmartCalc.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">While I was progtamming I've got an idea, I could try distribute my program. And I started do learn how to do .deb packages, that time it was really difficult, because Debian documentation was incomplete and sometimes I had to
                    just "try", but I did it. What is funny is that after 1 month I secceeded to build deb package, new debian documentation was releasd with more info about building debs. After I built deb package, I also built snap package for
                    SmartCalc.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">Once I was talking with my instructor, he told me that building GUIs is more difficult than building CLIs and that is reason why GUIs aren't included in our curriculum. Because I am ambicious, I sayed to myself: "I do want to do
                    difficult things and also I want to enhance SmartCalc", so I stardet do look for ways how to do GUI. Back then I was still python guy so first thing I tryed was PyQT and Tkinter, but I didn't like it, so I tryed other technologies
                    like GTK+ and Electron. I was facing big dilemma, learn GTK+ and continue with Python and build GUI with Gnome Glade or improve my HTML, JS and CSS skills (I knew basics of those languages, because I studyed it in my school).
                    I chose Electron because of my previous experience with web technology. So I started to study and practice JS, after I was able to use it on intermediate level I starded to study Electron.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">After I was capable of doing Electron.js, I could migrate SmartCalc into Electron.js. And that was what I did, because of my poor experience with web technologies it took me cca 2 months. While I was doing migration I've discovered
                    many functions of Electron.js, some of those I used (eg. build packages for all of OSes, etc.). When SmartCalc was successfully migrated I started to add features and improve it, this took significant amount of time, but I've
                    gained a lot of knowledge, and that is the most importnat, because SmartCalc was project that I started in order to improme my skills.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">In November 2018 my friend came and asked me if I know somebody that mekes websites, I sayed, I do. So I did website for him, I used&nbsp; Bootstrap, jQuery. He was happy with it and I also because now I could build websites, comunicate
                    with clients and more.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">When SmartCalc was usable enough, I decided do distribute it, so I built Snap package and published it to Snapstore. After week I got very first download of my work. It felt amazing and it motivated me to do more programming. So
                    I had enough motivation to work on it more, this motivation lasted me few months, but my school spamed me with work and after those month I had to do more school and less personal projects. My latest release of this package
                    is 0.2.3 and it was in 27. May 2019.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">In September 2019 my family enterprise had need for pricing software. Until this time we had to use Excel to price our work, but it was too time consuming and error prone, so I offer my father that I will find him business software,
                    I was looking it up on internet, but no solution was good for our enterprise. So I got an idea, let's make our own business software, now when I have experience with Electron.js I can build easily programs. So I started development
                    of FIM Trade Pricing Tool (short FPT) by sketching and making schema of our app, then I made front-end in Bootstrap Studio (I own professional lifetime license). It still used jQuery and Bootstrap as my first serious website,
                    but I was best I could. And after 2 months, app worked perfectly, enough for real world usage.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">I noticed about FPT that it needs some framework, because app is getting large. I started to look for technologies to migrate it into. Back then I didn't know any framework, so picking one ment also I have to learn it. I learned
                    fundamentals of those: Angular, Vue, React, Ember, Polymer. I tested each of those and picked Angular. I started migration and after 1 week I discovered Svelte. I've immediatelly stoped migration and tested Svelte. After test
                    I had clear which one I'll pick. So I spent 1 mont for learning Svelte, after I knew it I migrated FPT into.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">Now I was still continuing developing FPT, but I was also doing more websites, but this time I built them using Sapper so they now are SSR (only if cliend needed that). And also this is first time FPT was commercialy used.</p>
